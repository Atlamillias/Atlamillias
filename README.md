My name is Anthony! I'm a busybody that can't stand doing nothing. I work, play games, create weird Frankenstein projects, fix (or break) random crap, and *occasionally* write code (*really* don't get out much). I'm currently employed by Microchip Technology as an ESD lab technician. 

Roughly 5 years ago I started learning Python to *not* have to learn VBA for a work-related problem, and haven't stopped. Since then, I've also learned a bit of C, C#, Rust, and uh...VBA...
