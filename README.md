My name is Anthony! I'm a busybody that can't stand doing nothing. I work, play games, create weird Frankenstein projects, fix (or break) random crap, and *occasionally* write code. I started programming in Python in 2019 to avoid having to learn VBA for a work-related Excel problem. Since then, I've also learned a bit of C, C#, Rust, and uh...VBA...
